1. Inspiration
As stated by updated statistics, one billion people or 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability, such as vision, mobility, auditory or neurological.
But let’s go into a more detailed aspect – what does it mean having a form of disability?
We can all find that info on Wikipedia, a broad search engine that states: ‘’**A disability is any condition** that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or effectively interact with the world around them (socially or materially). These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability _may be present from birth or can be acquired during a person's lifetime_.’’
**On paper it seems to be easily defined but in real life, people having a disability find numerous obstacles in living a normal life or even close to that**, taking in consideration the world is not taking care of special needs or adapting itself to include benefits for all types of people – can you imagine losing your voice or your hearing for few days and then getting it back? Starting from this basic example, let’s put ourselves in a less fortunate person’s shoes and see that the struggle is real and society needs to develop more inclusive solutions for them as well – to be able to live a healthy, creative and normal life.

2. What it does

Now, let’s imagine a more complex situation – think of yourself as a person with a disability who needs to read a book they just received, but is not able to do that? Or even worse, you need to read the info about a product you are willing to buy but can’t find the way to do that?
Real life for a disabled person is hard in most situations and we can work to improve that in the close future.
Picture an app that could be your best friend in a bad day, assisting you in various situations and helping you stay on top of your game when fighting the disability, making it easy to interact in real life and solving big issues in seconds.
